function [agt]=eat(agt,cn)

%eating function for class HERRING
%agt=herring object
%cn - current agent number
%eaten = 1 if herring successfully finds a copepod, =0 otherwise

%SUMMARY OF HERRING EAT RULE
%Herring calculates distance to all copepods
%Herring identifies nearest copepod(s)
%If more than one equidistant within search radius, one is randomly picked
%Probability of herring killing copepod =1 - distance of copepod/speed of
%herring
%If probability > rand, herring moves to copepod location and copepod is
%killed
%If herring does not kill copepods, its food is decremented by one unit

%GLOBAL VARIABLES
%N_IT is current iteration number
%IT_STATS is data structure containing statistics on model at each
%iteration (no. agents etc)
%MESSAGES is a data structure containing information that agents need to
%broadcast to each other
   %    MESSAGES.atype - n x 1 array listing the type of each agent in the model
   %    (1=copepod, 2=herring, 3=dead agent)
   %    MESSAGES.pos - list of every agent position in [x y]
   %    MESSAGE.dead - n x1 array containing ones for agents that have died
   %    in the current iteration
