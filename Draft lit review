Background (Literature Review):
Atlantic Herring (Clupea Harengus) are a schooling fish that hunt Copepods using a technique known as "Ram Feeding". Copepods have an evasive jump that is faster than any individual Herring, but the Herring School forms a grid that corresponds to the typical jump distance of the Copepods. This report investigates whether schooling Herring are more effective at hunting Copepods than Herring schools with different grid distances or that are not formed in a school.

In the natural world, the relationship between prey and predators is an important feature of ecological systems (C. Chang, 2017) and is a necessity for biodiversity (W. Ripple 2004). There are many behaviours that prey adopt in response to predator stimuli.  These behaviours include predator encounter avoidance, escape facilitation and vigilance (A.J. Wirsing, 2010) which can be attributed to a reduction in population growth and lower reproduction levels due to the cost associated with the response (S. Creel, 2008). Prey behaviour and availability has been used to predict the density of predators in areas (A.J. Wirsing, 2007) and has been shown to indicate efficient opportunistic activity (R.A. Martin, 2012). 
Atlantic Herring, as a fish within the family of Clupeidae, have evolved to exhibit schooling behaviour as a method of evasion from higher tropic levels (Seghers, 1974). By moving in the same direction in a co-ordinated method, the Herring have developed a strategy that enhances individual safety (J.P. Rafferty, 2009) whilst each individual has only limited environmental information about its neighbours (D. Sinkovits, 2006). The fish are on average betwen 6 and 21.9cm long with a swimming speed between 70 and 134cm/s (H.C. Boyer 1961). These schools of Herring can be described using algorithms (R. Olfati-Saber, 2006) that provide rules of behaviour and lead to the emergence of flocking behaviour. 
Copepods have an observed escape behaviour, enabled by the detection of hydrodynamic disturbances which features an extremely fast jump evasion of up to 600 times their own body height (N. Wadhwa, 2014). They are between 0.03 and 0.05cm long and have a docile swimming speed at an average of 0.1cm/s (J.R. Strickler, 1995). They are preyed upon by a host of vertebrates and invertabrates; while their evasion behaviour seems efficient for certain planktivorous fish (E.J. Buskey, 2011), however predators feeding in flocks may negate this ability. When Atlantic Herring feed in schools, they adopt "ram feeding" behaviour where they swim open-mouthed to capture potential jumping copepods (J. Hussey, 2014).
It has been observed that many fish forage in schools but presented varying foraging rates depending on the schooling behaviour. Fish of the genus Haemulon have been observed to have higher feeding rates when foraging individually than when in schools (P.H.C. Pereira, 2012) although conversely, cyprinid studies have indicated that shoaling groups prooves advantageous for foraging rates (T.J. Pitcher, 1981). There have been few studies done on the functional advantages of schooling in terms of foraging but it has been generally agreed that optimal foraging among predators naturally evolve towards maximising the return per unit effort of caloric energy expendature (B.M. Marcotte 1986). 
It could be argued that some individual fish leave the schooling behavior when the costs outweigh the benefits attributed to the maturity of the fish (C.H. Ryer, 1990). An example of a cost of schooling behaviour is the size of the school increasing the competition for food (W.M. Hamner, 2000).
