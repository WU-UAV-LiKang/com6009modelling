Herring

0. Calc distance to all other agents based on MessageTablePrevious (maybe use a quadtree to make this efficient later)
1. Get a list of agents within sensing radius.
2. Eat copepods within eating radius.
3. Add movement forces to self.

	a. Calc separation force
		for each fish closer than X:
			calc vector pointing away from neighbor
			weight by distance
			add to sum
			add to count
		divide sum by count
		
	b. Calc alignment force
		for each fish closer than Y:
			add velocity
			add to count
		divide velocity by count
			
	c. Calc cohesion force
		for each fish closer than Z:
			add other_fish.position
			add to count
			
			divide sum of positions by count
			seek that divided sum
	
	d. Apply weighted sum of forces
	e. Steer based on force (basically, don't go over the max_speed, don't turn faster than herring can turn etc)
4. Update properties (position, velocity, acceleration, hunger etc) send to MessageTableCurrent

After all agents have been iterated over, set MessageTablePrevious = MessageTableCurrent
