Deadlines
	Plan:  17th April - 21 days
	Final: 14th May 3pm - 48 days

Task list:
	Part A and B happen in parallel
	
	Part 0: (Plan) [Due 17th April]
		read 4? papers
		choose a system to model - [3rd April]
			- Generate ideas
				- Sharks vs Schools of Fish - does flocking increase survival rate?
				- Hallibut hunting jellyfish
				- Dolphin hunting (maybe as an extension of sharks)
			- Figure out Pros and Cons
			- Choose as a group - SHARKS VS FISH!
			- Find academic papers on chosen topic - Pierre
			- Each read 1 academic paper
			
			- Maybe the fish could be atlantic herring, since they display flocking hunting behaviour, but also are hunted. 
		which entities are agents?
			- Things with position
				- Things which don't move
					- Food? (Maybe this could be food for the fish (e.g. Jellyfish)
					- Obstacles?
				- Things which move (agents? Or we could have moving food?)
					- Sharks
					- Fish (maybe herring?)
					- (if we choose herring) Copepods
		what states for the agents?
			- Sharks
				- Searching for food?
					- Smell
					- Sight
					- Scalloped hammerheads apparently school/flock?
					- 'Cruising' movement
				- Active hunting
					- 'Burst' movement
			- Fish
				- Searching for food?
				- Avoiding danger
				- Aligning with other fish
				- Keeping distance from other fish
				- Attracting to other fish
		what type of behaviour?
			- Sharks
				- Hunting patterns?
			- Fish
				- Flocking as a means of increasing survival rate?
				- (if we choose herring) Flocking as a means of catching more prey
		how to represent environment?
			- areas of high food? - varies dynamically
			- areas of preferred temperature? - doesn't vary
		time and length scales
			- 1s timestep?
			- 100cm grid size?
			- Atlantic Herring cruise at 108cm/s
		emergent behaviour generated?
			- Increased survival from predators
			- Increased hunting effectiveness
